| Webhooks<br>The objective is to confirm that the webhooks are triggered when certain states change and that it's removed when the connector is uninstalled.<br> | Verify that the webhook is triggered when the status of a payout changes.<br>Verify that the webhook is removed from the database when the connector is uninstalled.<br> |


## Cleanup Operations
On restart of the server after the server has been stopped without uninstalling the connector.
* Verify that we don't get a Signature Verification error and that we receive webhook events succesfully, and the workflow completes.
