You can move the binary to any executable path, such as to `/usr/local/bin`. Installations using brew, apt, yum or docker are also [available](https://docs.numary.com/oss/payments/get-started/installation).

```SHELL

# Dashboard

A simple [dashboard](https://github.com/numary/control) is built in the payments binary, to make it easier to visualize transactions. It can be started with:
